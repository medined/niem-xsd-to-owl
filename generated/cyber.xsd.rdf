In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named Zone.Identifier with a specific value known as the MOTW. Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file in not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1574.004 - Dylib Hijacking">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1055 - Process Injection">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1056 - Input Capture">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. Credential API Hooking) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. Web Portal Capture).</rdfs:label>

</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1090 - Proxy">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.</rdfs:label>

</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.</rdfs:label>

</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1102 - Web Service">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system.

</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1205 - Traffic Signaling">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1567 - Exfiltration Over Web Service">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1568 - Dynamic Resolution">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1569 - System Services">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. Adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely. Many services are set to run at boot, which can aid in achieving persistence (Create or Modify System Process), but adversaries can also abuse services for one-time or temporary execution.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Adversaries may copy files laterally between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares or with authenticated connections with SMB/Windows Admin Shares or Remote Desktop Protocol. Files can also be copied over on Mac and Linux with native tools like scp, rsync, and sftp.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1571 - Non-Standard Port">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port paring that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088 or port 587 as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1572 - Protocol Tunneling">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1573 - Encrypted Channel">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.</rdfs:label>
<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberEnterpriseTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1541 - Foreground Persistence">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may abuse Android's startForeground() API method to maintain continuous sensor access. Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope. Applications can retain sensor access by running in the foreground, using Android&#8217;s startForeground() API method. This informs the system that the user is actively interacting with the application, and it should not be killed. The only requirement to start a foreground service is showing a persistent notification to the user.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1544 - Remote File Copy">
<rdfs:label>Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.

</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1579 - Keychain">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may collect the keychain storage data from an iOS device to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for iOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as Wi-Fi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, private keys, and VPN credentials.</rdfs:label>

<rdf:type rdf:resource="#CyberMobileTechniqueCodeSimpleType"/>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1604 - Proxy Through Victim">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use a compromised device as a proxy server to the Internet. By utilizing a proxy, adversaries hide the true IP address of their C2 server and associated infrastructure from the destination of the network traffic. This masquerades an adversary&#8217;s traffic as legitimate traffic originating from the compromised device, which can evade IP-based restrictions and alerts on certain services, such as bank accounts and social media websites.</rdfs:label>

<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1605 - Command-Line Interface">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may use built-in command-line interfaces to interact with the device and execute commands. Android provides a bash shell that can be interacted with over the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or programmatically using Java&#8217;s Runtime package. On iOS, adversaries can interact with the underlying runtime shell if the device has been jailbroken.</rdfs:label>

</owl:NamedIndividual>
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="#T1617 - Hooking">
<rdfs:label>Adversaries may utilize hooking to hide the presence of artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Hooking can be used to modify return values or data structures of system APIs and function calls. This process typically involves using 3rd party root frameworks, such as Xposed or Magisk, with either a system exploit or pre-existing root access. By including custom modules for root frameworks, adversaries can hook system APIs and alter the return value and/or system data structures to alter functionality/visibility of various aspects of the system.</rdfs:label>
