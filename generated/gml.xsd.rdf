      <owl:Class rdf:about="#UomSymbol">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#gml.xsd"/>
<rdfs:comment>This type specifies a character string of length at least one, and restricted such that it must not contain any of the following characters: ":" (colon), " " (space), (newline), (carriage return), (tab). This allows values corresponding to familiar abbreviations, such as "kg", "m/s", etc. 
It is recommended that the symbol be an identifier for a unit of measure as specified in the "Unified Code of Units of Measure" (UCUM) (http://aurora.regenstrief.org/UCUM). This provides a set of symbols and a grammar for constructing identifiers for units of measure that are unique, and may be easily entered with a keyboard supporting the limited character set known as 7-bit ASCII. ISO 2955 formerly provided a specification with this scope, but was withdrawn in 2001. UCUM largely follows ISO 2955 with modifications to remove ambiguities and other problems.</rdfs:comment>

      <owl:Class rdf:about="#UomURI">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#gml.xsd"/>
<rdfs:comment>This type specifies a URI, restricted such that it must start with one of the following sequences: "#", "./", "../", or a string of characters followed by a ":". These patterns ensure that the most common URI forms are supported, including absolute and relative URIs and URIs that are simple fragment identifiers, but prohibits certain forms of relative URI that could be mistaken for unit of measure symbol . 
NOTE	It is possible to re-write such a relative URI to conform to the restriction (e.g. "./m/s").
In an instance document, on elements of type gml:MeasureType the mandatory uom attribute shall carry a value corresponding to either 
-	a conventional unit of measure symbol,
-	a link to a definition of a unit of measure that does not have a conventional symbol, or when it is desired to indicate a precise or variant definition.</rdfs:comment>

      <owl:Class rdf:about="#NilReasonType">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#gml.xsd"/>
<rdfs:comment>gml:NilReasonType defines a content model that allows recording of an explanation for a void value or other exception.
gml:NilReasonType is a union of the following enumerated values:
-	inapplicable there is no value
-	missing the correct value is not readily available to the sender of this data. Furthermore, a correct value may not exist
-	template the value will be available later
-	unknown the correct value is not known to, and not computable by, the sender of this data. However, a correct value probably exists
-	withheld the value is not divulged
-	other:text other brief explanation, where text is a string of two or more characters with no included spaces
and
-	anyURI which should refer to a resource which describes the reason for the exception
A particular community may choose to assign more detailed semantics to the standard values provided. Alternatively, the URI method enables a specific or more complete explanation for the absence of a value to be provided elsewhere and indicated by-reference in an instance document.
gml:NilReasonType is used as a member of a union in a number of simple content types where it is necessary to permit a value from the NilReasonType union as an alternative to the primary type.</rdfs:comment>
